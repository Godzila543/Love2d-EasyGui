# Love2d-EasyGui
An in development Gui library for Love2d
Im currently just developing this for fun, not even to be used.
to use simply put the GUI folder and EasyGui.lua in the same folder, and add a line to your code along the lines of 
YOURCHOICE=require("EasyGui"). I use the name gui, but its up to you. I will try to add up to date examples as I develop
